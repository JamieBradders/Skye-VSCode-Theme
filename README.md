# Skye, a VS Code theme based on TailwindCSS

Hello, and thank you for downloading my VS Code Theme, Skye.

**Random Fact:** I decided to name the theme after my dog. Skye is a Border Collie, crazy, and has absolutely no relevance to web development! Other than being sat next to me when I published the extension.

## Why did I build Skye?

I have based Skye on the syntax theme used on [TailwindCSS.com](https://tailwindcss.com/). I think it's fantastic, and I couldn't find an extension on the Visual Studio Marketplace which matched it.

## Skye Is a Work in Progress

If you have downloaded the theme, be prepared to find some bugs. I am constantly improving the package, but you are likely to encounter inconsistencies as I continue to test all of the different elements in VS Code.

## I've Found an Issue!

If you find a problem with the package, please raise an issue on [Skye's Github Page](https://github.com/JamieBradders/Skye-VSCode-Theme). Also, if you would like to contribute to the project, please submit a Pull Request, and I will review it as soon as possible.
